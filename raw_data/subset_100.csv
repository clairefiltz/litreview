1D system and the distribution function of electrons over single-particle
states are studied in detail to show that there are two universal features in
their behavior, which characterize the electron ordering and the deformation of
Wigner crystal by boundaries. The distribution function has a $\delta$-like
singularity at the Fermi momentum $k_F$. The Fourier spectrum of the density
has a step-like form at the wavevector $2k_F$, with the harmonics being absent
or vanishing above this threshold. These features are found by calculations
using exact diagonalization method. They are shown to be caused by Wigner
ordering of electrons, affected by the boundaries. However the common Luttinger
liquid model with open boundaries fails to capture these features, because it
overestimates the deformation of the Wigner crystal. An improvement of the
Luttinger liquid model is proposed which allows one to describe the above
features correctly. It is based on the corrected form of the density operator
conserving the particle number.

that the homotopy categories of DGLAs and SHLAs (L infinity algebras)

with the derived stacks of Toen--Vezzosi and Lurie. Another application is that
the cohomology groups associated to any classical deformation problem (in any

crucially on the assumption of a flat prior distribution. However, previous
calculations in simplified landscape models showed that the prior distribution
is staggered, suggesting a conflict with anthropic predictions. Here we
analytically calculate the full distribution, including the prior and anthropic
selection effects, in a toy landscape model with a realistic number of vacua,
$N \sim 10^{500}$. We show that it is possible for the fractal prior
distribution we find to behave as an effectively flat distribution in a wide
class of landscapes, depending on the regime of parameter space. Whether or not
this possibility is realized depends on presently unknown details of the
landscape.

degree sequence is analyzed. Let $(W_t)_{t\geq 1}$ be an i.i.d. sequence. The
graph process is defined so that, at each integer time $t$, a new vertex, with
$W_t$ edges attached to it, is added to the graph. The new edges added at time
t are then preferentially connected to older vertices, i.e., conditionally on
$G(t-1)$, the probability that a given edge is connected to vertex i is
proportional to $d_i(t-1)+\delta$, where $d_i(t-1)$ is the degree of vertex $i$
at time $t-1$, independently of the other edges. The main result is that the
asymptotical degree sequence for this process is a power law with exponent
$\tau=\min\{\tau_{W}, \tau_{P}\}$, where $\tau_{W}$ is the power-law exponent
of the initial degrees $(W_t)_{t\geq 1}$ and $\tau_{P}$ the exponent predicted

Actualization of Potential, or CAP) for describing how entities change over
time under the influence of a context. The approach facilitates comparison of
change of state of entities studied in different disciplines. Processes are
seen to differ according to the degree of nondeterminism, and the degree to
which they are sensitive to, internalize, and depend upon a particular context.
Our analysis suggests that the dynamical evolution of a quantum entity
described by the Schrodinger equation is not fundamentally different from
change provoked by a measurement often referred to as collapse, but a limiting
case, with only one way to collapse. The biological transition to coded
replication is seen as a means of preserving structure in the fact of
context-driven change, and sextual replication as a means of increasing
potentiality thus enhancing diversity through interaction with context. The
framework sheds light on concepts like selection and fitness, reveals how
exceptional Darwinian evolution is as a means of 'change of state', and
clarifies in what sense culture, and the creative process underlying it, are
Darwinian.

representations of the Poincare group with the corresponding Young tableaux
having two rows, on a basis of the BRST approach. Starting with a description
of fermionic higher-spin fields in a flat space of any dimension in terms of an
auxiliary Fock space, we realize a conversion of the initial operator
constraint system (constructed with respect to the relations extracting
irreducible Poincare-group representations) into a first-class constraint
system. For this purpose, we find auxiliary representations of the constraint
subsuperalgebra containing the subsystem of second-class constraints in terms
of Verma modules. We propose a universal procedure of constructing
gauge-invariant Lagrangians with reducible gauge symmetries describing the
dynamics of both massless and massive fermionic fields of any spin. No
off-shell constraints for the fields and gauge parameters are used from the
very beginning. It is shown that the space of BRST cohomologies with a
vanishing ghost number is determined only by the constraints corresponding to
an irreducible Poincare-group representation. To illustrate the general
construction, we obtain a Lagrangian description of fermionic fields with
generalized spin (3/2,1/2) and (3/2,3/2) on a flat background containing the
complete set of auxiliary fields and gauge symmetries.

virtually enumerating pairs $(C,D)$ where $C\subset X$ is an embedded curve and
$D\subset C$ is a divisor. A virtual class is constructed on the associated
moduli space by viewing a pair as an object in the derived category of $X$. The
resulting invariants are conjecturally equivalent, after universal
transformations, to both the Gromov-Witten and DT theories of $X$. For
Calabi-Yau 3-folds, the latter equivalence should be viewed as a wall-crossing
formula in the derived category.
  Several calculations of the new invariants are carried out. In the Fano case,
the local contributions of nonsingular embedded curves are found. In the local
toric Calabi-Yau case, a completely new form of the topological vertex is
described.
  The virtual enumeration of pairs is closely related to the geometry
underlying the BPS state counts of Gopakumar and Vafa. We prove that our
integrality predictions for Gromov-Witten invariants agree with the BPS
integrality. Conversely, the BPS geometry imposes strong conditions on the
enumeration of pairs.

systematically the informational conception is presented in the paper ""The

Universe - and Universe as a whole - are some informational systems
(structures), which exist as uninterruptedly transforming [practically]
infinitesimal sub-sets of the absolutely infinite and fundamental set
""Information"". Such a conception allows not only to clear essentially a number
of metaphysical and epistemological problems in philosophy but, besides, allows
to suggest a reasonable physical model. Since Matter in Universe is an
informational system where any interaction between Matter's sub-structures,
i.e. - particles and systems of the particles - happens always as an exchange
by exclusively true information between these structures, the model is based on
the conjecture that Matter is some analogue of computer. The conjecture, in
turn, allows to introduce in the model the basic logical elements that
constitute the material structures and support the informational exchange -
i.e. the forces - between the structures. The model is experimentally testable
and yet now makes be more clear a number of basic problems in special
relativity, quantum mechanics, and, rather probably, in [now - in Newtonian]
gravity.

relativity theory by a convention or definition. This definition leads to
different simultaneities across inertial frames and the well known principle of
relativity of simultaneity. The lack of a universal present implies the
existence of past, present and future as a collection of events on a four
dimensional manifold or continuum wherein three dimensions are space like and
one dimension is time like. However, such a continuum precludes the possibility
of evolution of future from the present as all events exist forever so to speak
on the continuum with the tenses past, present and future merely being
perceptions of different inertial frames. Such a far-reaching ontological
concept, created by a mere convention, is yet to gain full acceptance. In this

simultaneous events are simultaneous in all inertial frames, and subscribe to
evolution of future from the present.

analyzed and found limited by relatively large cluster sizes due to
restrictions imposed by theoretical assumptions. An assumption about the steady
state ripening regime poses an upper limit, while another, implicit assumption
of continuous description poses a cluster size-dependent lower limit on the
supersaturation level. These two limits mismatch for the clusters under certain
size in the nanometer scale making the theory inapplicable. We present a more
generic, molecular theory of Ostwald ripening, which reproduces classical
Lifshitz-Slyozov and Wagner theories in appropriate extreme cases. This theory
has a wider applicability than classical theories, especially at lower
supersaturation levels, and is more suitable for nanoscale systems.

of the normalization of the luminosity function, a steepening of its slope is
also expected in underdense fields, similarly to what is observed within voids
in the local universe. Therefore, to avoid introducing artificial biases,
caution must be taken when attempting to correct for field underdensity, such
as in the case of HST UDF i-dropout sample, which exhibits a deficit of bright

pseudo-Euclidean (Lorentzian) geometry of space-time. However, as it is
explicitly stated in General Relativity, the geometry itself depends on
dynamics, specifically, on the energy-momentum tensor. We discuss a few
examples, which illustrate the dynamical aspect of the length-contraction
effect within the framework of Special Relativity. We show some pitfalls
associated with direct application of the length contraction formula in cases
when an extended object is accelerated. Our analysis reveals intimate
connections between length contraction and the dynamics of internal forces
within the accelerated system.
  The developed approach is used to analyze the correlation between two
congruent disks - one stationary and one rotating (the Ehrenfest paradox).
Specifically, we consider the transition of a disk from the state of rest to a
spinning state under the applied forces. It reveals the underlying physical
mechanism in the corresponding transition from Euclidean geometry of stationary
disk to Lobachevsky's (hyperbolic) geometry of the spinning disk in the process
of its rotational boost. A conclusion is made that the rest mass of a spinning
disk or ring of a fixed radius must contain an additional term representing the
potential energy of non-Euclidean circumferential deformation of its material.
Possible experimentally observable manifestations of Lobachevsky's geometry of
rotating systems are discussed.

distribution of initial states exhibits damped oscillations with a relatively
short decay time. The latter is determined by the temperature, the
single-particle level spacing, and the ground state value of the BCS gap for
the new coupling. In contrast, the decay is essentially absent when the system
was in a superfluid phase before the coupling increase.

total number of oracle queries asked by the key generation, signing, and
verification algorithms. That is, any such scheme can be broken with
probability close to $1$ by a (computationally unbounded) adversary making
$2^{(1+o(1))q}$ queries to the oracle. This is tight up to a constant factor in
the number of queries, since a simple modification of Lamport's one-time
signatures (Lamport '79) achieves $2^{(0.812-o(1))q}$ black-box security using
$q$ queries to the oracle.
  Our result extends (with a loss of a constant factor in the number of
queries) also to the random permutation and ideal-cipher oracles. Since the
symmetric primitives (e.g. block ciphers, hash functions, and message
authentication codes) can be constructed by a constant number of queries to the
mentioned oracles, as corollary we get lower bounds on the efficiency of
signature schemes from symmetric primitives when the construction is black-box.
This can be taken as evidence of an inherent efficiency gap between signature
schemes and symmetric primitives.

60,0802.2889,D.F.Roscoe,A complete Leibniz-Mach cosmology: From the Leibniz Question to MOND,,['astro-ph'],"  The claim that the large scale structure of the Universe is hierarchical has
a very long history going back at least to Charlier's papers of the early 20th
century. In recent years, the debate has centered largely on the works of Sylos
Labini, Joyce, Pietronero and others, who have made the quantative claim that
the large scale structure of the Universe is quasi-fractal with fractal
dimension $D\approx 2$. There is now a concensus that this is the case on
medium scales, with the main debate revolving around what happens on the scales
of the largest available modern surveys.
  This paper, which is a realization of a worldview which is deeply rooted in
the ideas of Leibniz and Mach shows, as a very special case of a general
formalism, that such a fractal $D\approx 2$ world is necessarily a world of
dynamical equilibrium.
  We use the cosmology to write down a simple galaxy model as an arbitrary
spherically symmetric bounded perturbation of the $D\approx 2$ equilibrium
environment. A necessary mass continuity condition on the perturbation boundary
between galactic interior and the exterior environment immediately defines that
boundary as a critical acceleration boundary with $a_0 \sim 4\pi G \Sigma_F$
where $a_0$ is the critical acceleration parameter and $\Sigma_F$ is the
characteristic mass surface density of the $D \approx 2$ fractal environment.
The MOND acceleration condition $V_0^2/R_0 = a_0$ for circular orbits on the
critical boundary follows in a straightforward manner.

  contrarian floaters",,['physics.soc-ph'],"  We assume a community whose members adopt one of two opinions $A$ or $B$.
Each member appears as an inflexible, or as a non-contrarian or contrarian
floater. An inflexible sticks to its opinion, whereas a floater may change into
a floater of the alternative opinion. The occurrence of this change is governed
by the local majority rule: members meet in groups of a fixed size, and a
floater then changes its opinion provided it is a minority in the group.
Subsequently, a non-contrarian floater keeps the opinion as adopted under the
local majority rule, whereas a contrarian floater adopts the alternative
opinion. Whereas the effects of on the one hand inflexibles and on the other
hand non-contrarians and contrarians have previously been studied seperately,
the current approach allows us to gain insight in the effect of their combined
presence in a community. Given fixed proportions of inflexibles $(\alpha_{A},
\alpha_{B})$ for the two opinions, and fixed fractions of contrarians
$(\gamma_{A}, \gamma_{B})$ among the $A$ and $B$ floaters, we derive the update
equation $p_{t+1}$ for the overall support for opinion $A$ at time $t+1$, given
$p_{t}$. The update equation is derived respectively for local group sizes 1, 2
and 3. The associated dynamics generated by repeated local updates is then
determined to identify its asymptotic steady configuration. The full opinion
flow diagram is thus obtained, showing conditions in terms of the parameters
for each opinion to eventually win the competing dynamics. Various dynamical
scenarios are thus exhibited, and it is derived that relatively small densities
of inflexibles allow for more variation in the qualitative outcome of the
dynamics than higher densities of inflexibles.

relativity. The text of the book includes definition of geometrical object,
concept of reference frame, geometry of metric-affinne manifold. Using this
concept I learn few physical applications: dynamics and Lorentz transformation
in gravitational fields, Doppler shift.
  A reference frame in event space is a smooth field of orthonormal bases.
Every reference frame is equipped by anholonomic coordinates. Using anholonomic
coordinates allows to find out relative speed of two observers and appropriate
Lorentz transformation. Synchronization of a reference frame is an anholonomic
time coordinate. Simple calculations show how synchronization influences time
measurement in the vicinity of the Earth. Measurement of Doppler shift from the
star orbiting the black hole helps to determine mass of the black hole.
  We call a manifold with torsion and nonmetricity the metric\hyph affine
manifold. The nonmetricity leads to a difference between the auto parallel line
and the extreme line, and to a change in the expression of the Frenet transport
and moving basis. The torsion leads to a change in the Killing equation. We
also need to add a similar equation for the connection.
  The analysis of the Frenet transport leads to the concept of the Cartan
transport and an introduction of the connection compatible with the metric
tensor. The dynamics of a particle follows to the Cartan transport. We need
additional physical constraints to make a nonmetricity observable. Learning how
torsion influences on tidal force reveals similarity between tidal equation for

learning domain and has many applications in different scientific areas. In
this paper, a theoretical framework for such estimation based on copula and
copula entropy -- the probabilistic theory of representation and measurement of
statistical dependence, is proposed. Graphical models are considered as a
special case of the copula framework. A method of the framework for estimating
maximum spanning copula is proposed. Due to copula, the method is irrelevant to
the properties of individual variables, insensitive to outlier and able to deal
with non-Gaussianity. Experiments on both simulated data and real dataset
demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

72,0805.1293,Avik Chakraborty,Testability of Reversible Iterative Logic Arrays,,['cs.OH'],"  Iterative Logic Arrays (ILAs) are ideal as VLSI sub-systems because of their
regular structure and its close resemblance with FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate
Arrays). Reversible circuits are of interest in the design of very low power
circuits where energy loss implied by high frequency switching is not of much
consideration. Reversibility is essential for Quantum Computing. This paper
examines the testability of Reversible Iterative Logic Arrays (ILAs) composed
of reversible k-CNOT gates. For certain ILAs it is possible to find a test set
whose size remains constant irrespective of the size of the ILA, while for
others it varies with array size. Former type of ILAs is known as
Constant-Testable, i.e. C-Testable. It has been shown that Reversible Logic
Arrays are C-Testable and size of test set is equal to number of entries in
cells truth table implying that the reversible ILAs are also Optimal-Testable,
i.e. O-Testable. Uniform-Testability, i.e. U-Testability has been defined and
Reversible Heterogeneous ILAs have been characterized as U-Testable. The test
generation problem has been shown to be related to certain properties of cycles
in a set of graphs derived from cell truth table. By careful analysis of these
cycles an efficient test generation technique that can be easily converted to
an ATPG program has been presented for both 1-D and 2D ILAs. The same
algorithms can be easily extended for n-Dimensional Reversible ILAs.

generalized squeezing operator $\exp{(z{a^{\dagger k}}-z^*a^k)}$ for arbitrary
positive integer $k$. The states are given explicitly in the number
representation. We find that for a given value of $k$ there are $k$ such

$n\to\infty$. This implies that for any $k\geq3$ the states are normalizable.
For a given $k$, the expectation values of operators of the form $(a^{\dagger}
a)^j$ are finite for positive integer $j < (k/2-1)$ but diverge for integer
$j\geq (k/2-1)$. For $k=3$ we also give an explicit form of these states in the
momentum representation in terms of Bessel functions.

by combining quantum cryptographic techniques and some ideas in classical
cryptography. In the presented scheme, the signatory and the receiver can share
a long-term secret key with the arbitrator by utilizing the key together with a

between the signatory and the arbitrator or between the receiver and the

rotational-dynamics, with a distribution of its own mass, rotating around its
center with a higher density, like spiral galaxies happen, by means of a
classical calculus of the rotation velocities of a particle around its
rotational axis, inside a smoothed distribution of matter. The stars are
supposed to be particles and their distribution in the galaxy is modelled as a
matter distribution inversely proportional to its distance from its center. Two
kinds of matter distribution are supposed: one with constant density, and other
with radial distribution. Two types of galaxy symmetry are also considered:
spherical and oblate ellipsoidal. Using only classical mechanics arguments it
is shown that the calculated velocity distribution inside the galaxy is similar
to that obtained from astronomical observations, without the necessity of
suppose the existence of dark matter or other phenomena.

New class Colombeau solutions to Einstein field equations is obtained.New class
Colombeau solutions to Einstein field equations is obtained. The vacuum energy
density of free scalar quantum field ${\Phi}$ with a distributional background
spacetime also is considered.It has been widely believed that, except in very
extreme situations, the influence of acceleration on quantum fields should
amount to just small, sub-dominant contributions. Here we argue that this
belief is wrong by showing that in a Rindler distributional background
spacetime with distributional Levi-Civit\`a connection the vacuum energy of
free quantum fields is forced, by the very same background distributional
space-time such a Rindler distributional background space-time, to become
dominant over any classical energy density component.This semiclassical gravity
effect finds its roots in the singular behavior of quantum fields on a Rindler
distributional space-times with distributional Levi-Civit\`a connection. In
particular we obtain that the vacuum fluctuations $<{\Phi}^2({\delta})>$ have a
singular behavior at a Rindler horizon $\delta = 0$.Therefore sufficiently
strongly accelerated observer burns up near the Rindler horizon. Thus
Polchinski account does not violate of the Einstein equivalence principle.

approximation, enables us to reduce to the case when both $A$, $
G_\mathfrak{a}(A) = \bigoplus_{n \geq 0} \mathfrak{a}^n/\mathfrak{a}^{n+1} $
are complete intersections and $M$ is a maximal CM $A$-module. The second step
consists of analyzing the classical filtration $\{Hom_A(M,\mathfrak{a}^n)
\}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ of the dual $Hom_A(M,A)$. We give many applications of this
point of view. For instance let $(A,\mathfrak{m})$ be equicharacteristic and
CM. Let $a(G_\mathfrak{a}(A))$ be the $a$-invariant of $G_\mathfrak{a}(A)$. We
prove:
  1. $a(G_\mathfrak{a}(A)) = -\dim A$ iff $\mathfrak{a}$ is generated by a
regular sequence.
  2. If $\mathfrak{a}$ is integrally closed and $a(G_\mathfrak{a}(A)) = -\dim A

another application

85,0807.1793,Dhananjay P. Mehendale,On Entanglement and Separability,,['math.GM'],"  We present a new necessary and sufficient condition to determine the
entanglement status of an arbitrary N-qubit quantum state (maybe pure or mixed)
represented by a density matrix. A necessary condition satisfied by separable
bipartite quantum states was obtained by A. Peres, [1]. A. Peres showed that if
a bipartite state represented by the density matrix is separable then its
partial transpose is positive semidefinite and has no negative eigenvalues. In
other words, if the partial transpose is not positive semidefinite and so one
or more of its eigenvalues are negative then the state represented by the
corresponding density matrix is entangled. It was then shown by M. Horodecki
et.al, [2], that this necessary condition is also sufficient for two-by-two and
two-by-three dimensional systems. However, in other dimensions, it was shown by
P. Horodecki, [3], that the criterion due to A. Peres is not sufficient. In
this paper, we develop a new approach and a new criterion for deciding the
entanglement status of the states represented by the density matrices
corresponding to N-qubit systems. We begin with a 2-qubit case and then show
that these results for 2-qubit systems can be extended to N-qubit systems by
proceeding along similar lines. We discuss few examples to illustrate the
method proposed in this paper for testing the entanglement status of few
density matrices.

Over algebraically closed fields of positive characteristics we describe the
deforms (results of deformations) of all known simple finite-dimensional
symmetric Lie (super)algebras of rank $<9$, except for superizations of the Lie
algebras with ADE root systems.
  The moduli of deformations of any Lie superalgebra constitute a supervariety.
Any infinitesimal deformation given by any odd cocycle is integrable with an
odd parameter running over a~supervariety. All deforms corresponding to odd
cocycles are new. Among new results are classification of the deforms of the
29-dimensional Brown algebra in characteristic 3, of Weisfeiler-Kac algebras
and orthogonal Lie algebras without Cartan matrix in characteristic 2.
  For the Lie (super)algebras considered, all cocycles are integrable, the
deforms corresponding to the weight cocycles are usually linear in the
parameter. Problem: describe isomorphic deforms.
  Appendix: For several modular analogs of complex simple Lie algebras, and
simple Lie algebras indigenous to characteristics 3 and 2, we describe the
space of cohomology with trivial coefficients. We show that the natural
multiplication in this space is very complicated.

  Theorem. Let S be a triangulation of a circle with s vertices. Let f be a

embeddings if and only if for each i=0,...,s the i-th derivative of the map f

98,0809.2093,"Troy Lee, Adi Shraibman",An approximation algorithm for approximation rank,,['cs.CC'],"  One of the strongest techniques available for showing lower bounds on quantum
communication complexity is the logarithm of the approximation rank of the
communication matrix--the minimum rank of a matrix which is entrywise close to
the communication matrix. This technique has two main drawbacks: it is
difficult to compute, and it is not known to lower bound quantum communication
complexity with entanglement.
  Linial and Shraibman recently introduced a norm, called gamma_2^{alpha}, to
quantum communication complexity, showing that it can be used to lower bound
communication with entanglement. Here the parameter alpha is a measure of
approximation which is related to the allowable error probability of the
protocol. This bound can be written as a semidefinite program and gives bounds
at least as large as many techniques in the literature, although it is smaller
than the corresponding alpha-approximation rank, rk_alpha. We show that in fact
log gamma_2^{alpha}(A)$ and log rk_{alpha}(A)$ agree up to small factors. As
corollaries we obtain a constant factor polynomial time approximation algorithm
to the logarithm of approximate rank, and that the logarithm of approximation
rank is a lower bound for quantum communication complexity with entanglement.
